    <!-- 
    JavaScript is known as object oriented interpreter scripting language, From ES6 onward
    but before it was Object Based interpreter scripting language till ES5.

    Object is a real-world entity.
    Interpreter means checking the code line by line.

    In some Programming language we have to generate a file and have to run it to get the 
    output, but in scripting language it will directly check the code language and get the output, It will not 
    generate in a different file

    ES means ECMA.
    ECMA: European Computer Manufacturers Association.
    ES is a concept. JavaScript is one of the implementation of the concept.

    ES6 is introduced in 2015

    Using JS we can do programming on the web page without any tool or server.(Means we don't need any 3rd Party Tools
    to run the programming)
